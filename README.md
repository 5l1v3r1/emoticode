# EmotiCODE v2.0

This is the code repository for v2.0 of [emoticode.net](http://www.emoticode.net/) which is going to be published as soon as it will be finished.  
It's a complete rewrite of the original website, which was written in PHP, in **Ruby on Rails** using MySQL
as DBMS ( maybe I will switch to PostgreSQL ) and all the Rails magic.  
I've started this new version to learn Rails advanced concepts, but I'm still a new comer in this world so if you find any bug or bad practice please feel free to open an issue here on GitHub.  

  
**This is still unfinished software!** This is a screenshot of how's going so far:
